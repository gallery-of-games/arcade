## Problem Domain

- While the Hangman Game may not have a direct impact on societal issues, it can be used as a tool for educational purposes to enhance vocabulary, spelling, and language skills, particularly for children. It never fails to be a fun way to promote social interaction and teamwork, as players can work together to guess the hidden word.

## Algorithm

- The PseudoQueue implementation uses two Stack instances to insert and remove values, with the first Stack holding the inserted values and the second Stack holding the removed values. When the second Stack is empty, the values from the first Stack are popped and pushed onto the second Stack to reverse their order, so that a first-in, first-out approach is implemented.the game
Big O


- The Hangman Game algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), which means that the time it takes to run the algorithm increases as the number of letters in the chosen word increases. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), which means that the amount of memory used to run the algorithm stays the same regardless of the size of the chosen word.
